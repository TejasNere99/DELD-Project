## 📘 Overview
This project explores the concept of **Bus Systems** in digital electronics — the core of communication between components like the **CPU**, **Memory**, and **Input/Output devices**.  
It highlights how **data**, **address**, and **control** signals flow through buses, ensuring synchronized and efficient performance in a digital system.

---

## 🧩 Abstract
Bus Systems in Digital Electronics are essential for connecting various hardware modules.  
A **bus** acts as a shared pathway for transferring:
- **Data** between devices  
- **Addresses** for identifying locations  
- **Control signals** for coordinating operations  

Together, these buses ensure **reliable**, **fast**, and **scalable** digital circuit performance.

## ⚙️ Expected Input
- Digital signals  
- Address lines  
- Control signals  
- Clock pulses  

## 💡 Expected Output
- Reliable data transfer  
- Synchronized communication  
- Efficient overall system performance
